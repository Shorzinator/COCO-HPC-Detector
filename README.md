# COCO-HPC-Detector

## Description

### The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset is an invaluable resource in computer vision - a large-scale dataset designed to facilitate research in object recognition, segmentation, and captioning. It provides a diverse array of images annotated with object segmentation, keypoints, and bounding boxes. This dataset is pivotal in training and evaluating machine learning models for tasks like object detection and segmentation.
